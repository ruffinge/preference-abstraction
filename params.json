See the accompanying [`NOTICE.md`](NOTICE.md)\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nThis library provides an easy-to-use system for abstracting several different\r\npotential methods of storing application preference data, including files stored\r\nin the same directory as the application, files in a user's home directory, and\r\nnative system preference storage structures.\r\n\r\nAbilities\r\n---------\r\nThis abstraction system is currently limited to storing a single tier of \r\npreferences for any Java package (i.e., non-hierarchical). The focus in \r\ndevelopment has been to create a unified interface for storing and retrieving\r\npreferences in a variety of mediums.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
